# Mercari API server

Uses the mercari API I wrote [here](https://github.com/marvinody/mercari-js/) and provides quick wrappings around that.

I recommend deploying your own version using heroku (super simple)

- create heroku account and get cli tools
- `heroku login`
- `git clone https://github.com/marvinody/mercari-server`
- `heroku create <name of your app>` (maybe mercari-server-mine) or something silly
- `git push heroku master`

And now you have your own version!

If the service breaks, please reach out to me on the other repo by making an issue there since this doesn't really do much...
